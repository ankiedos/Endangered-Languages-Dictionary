        This project aims to be a dictionary for as much as possible of world's languages that are at risk of extinction. A few examples are:
        <ul id="langs">
            <li>(x) Kashubian</li>
            <li>() Lower Sorbian</li>
            <li>() Upper Sorbian (though it is gaining popularity among the descendants of the native speakers nowadays)</li>
            <li>() Rusyn</li>
            <li>() Wymysiöeryś (Vilamovian)</li>
            <li>() Yiddish</li>
            <li>() Ainu</li>
            <li>() Manchu</li>
            <li>() a lot of Caucasian languages</li>
            <li>() and many more...</li>
        </ul>
        Apart from that, this website is going to be available in different languages. Here's a list of ready & planned:
        <ul id="translations">
            <li>(x) English</li>
            <li>(x) Polish</li>
            <li>() Spanish</li>
            <li>() German</li>
            <li>() Ukrainian</li>
            <li>() Those which the dictionary has phrases in</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="stylisation">Why there are such white & not much styled webpages?!!</h1>
        <p>This is a dictionary, which is an interlanguage medium associating phrases of different languages with each other. A dictionary is not an artwork. People use it to find out an analogous or a similar phrase in another language, not to please their eyes.</p>
        Therefore, it does not depend heavily on stylesheets. I hope this is understandable.<br>

        <h1 id="development">Any plans on extending this?</h1>
        Yes. The plan is to create a vortal about languages. A detailed roadmap follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Assign definitions to various translations of entries</li>
            <li>Create lessons & excercises on the languages handled by the dictionary</li>
            <li>Extend this website so that the previous version will be just a section</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sections for auxiliary, research, logical & philosophical, artistic, and other constructed languages</li>
                <li>Sections for natural languages, differentiated by the families they belong to</li>
                <li>Sections for pidgins and creoles</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Create resources on linguistics, especially phonetics & IPA</li>
            <li>Create resources about cultures of the world</li>
            <li>Create a forum (& a collaborative platform for constructed languages), but when the website will be hosted somewhere else, hence getting a prospect of being a dynamic one</li>
        </ul>
