# Endangered Languages Dictionary
This project aims to be a dictionary for as much as possible of world's languages that are at risk of extinction. A few examples are:
- [x] Kashubian
- [] Lower Sorbian
- [] Upper Sorbian (though it is gaining popularity among the descendants of the native speakers nowadays)
- [] Rusyn
- [] Wymysiöeryś (Vilamovian)
- [] Yiddish
- [] Ainu
- [] Manchu
- [] a lot of Caucasian languages
- [] and many more...
Apart from that, this website is going to be available in different languages. Here's a list of ready & planned:
- [x] English
- [x] Polish
- [] Spanish
- [] German
- [] Ukrainian
- [] Those which the dictionary has phrases in

# Why there are such white & not much styled webpages?!!
This is a dictionary, which is an interlanguage medium associating phrases of different languages with each other. A dictionary is not an artwork. People use it to find out an analogous or a similar phrase in another language, not to please their eyes.
Therefore, it does not depend heavily on stylesheets. I hope this is understandable.

# Any plans on extending this?
Yes. The plan is to create a vortal about languages. A detailed roadmap follows:
- Create lessons & excercises on the languages handled by the dictionary
- Extend this website so that the previous version will be just a section
  - Sections for auxiliary, research, logical & philosophical, artistic, and other constructed languages
  - Sections for natural languages, differentiated by the families they belong to
  - Sections for pidgins and creoles
- Create resources on linguistics, especially phonetics & IPA
- Create resources about cultures of the world
- Create a forum (& a collaborative platform for constructed languages), but when the website will be hosted somewhere else, hence getting a prospect of being a dynamic one
